        // HashMap, check its usage in the JDK, used in a lot of places.
        // HashMap - 2600
        // ArrayList - 4900
        // 1.8 uses a tree if there are too many clashes.
        // In the past, the HashMap used the remainder function % to decide where to place entries in the HashMap.  Since Java 1.4 they use bit masking (much faster).  The problem is that bit masking is very sensitive to strange bit patterns.  Imagine for example using float as a key.  A lot of float numbers have the same mantissa, so would end up in the same bucket.  This is why they need to XOR and SHIFT bits around a bit to give a better distribution of bits, hopefully with the differences being in the lower bits.  If you have 1 million entries in the map, and the bottom 10 bits are always the same, you won't have a great lookup performance.  Since Java 8 they changed the lookup to O(log n) instead of O(n) by implementing a tree when a bucket had too many clashes.  That was good.  However, they also oversimplified the re-hash() function inside HashMap to only do basically (hash >>> 16) ^ hash.  So my suggestion now is - your hashCode() should be as unique as possible, and the range of values should be as small as possible.

        );

        mMap.putList(13, "eleven");
        mMap.putList(11, "other eleven");
        System.out.println(mMap);
